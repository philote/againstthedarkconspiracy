    "description": "The classic example is the forced transformation of a werewolf during a full moon, but any change in the threat, its Powers, Weaknesses, Vulnerabilities, or its behaviors due to phase of moon, sun, season etc. is also included. A vampire may not be hurt by sunlight, but perhaps is compelled to seek shade for some reason. Perhaps the fae cannot use its Powers at a particular time of year, or a Demon is weak on Sundays, so there’s a predictability about their activity.",
