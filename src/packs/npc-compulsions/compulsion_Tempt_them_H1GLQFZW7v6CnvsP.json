    "description": "Some Supernaturals will avoid harming an Operator if they think they might make an effective pawn or Servitor. An Operator who is fascinated by the blasphemous unknown is a prime target. There is no mechanic for this unless the player wants to have the choice of whether they succumb, or not, taken out of their hands. In that case a failed roll for Stress can substitute for a choice. If an Operator goes through with becoming a pawn of the Conspiracy then the player treats it as if their Operator had ‘cracked’ (see Stress).",
