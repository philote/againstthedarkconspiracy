    "description": "Control will agree if sufficient exposure to a Deterrent, or making it sufficiently intense, can turn it into a Vulnerability.\nThis could mean that prolonged exposure to sunlight does real harm to the threat. It could be that immersion in running water is effective or that thermite burns at such a high temperature that it turns a fire Deterrent into an effective Vulnerability. Operators will need to hold the threat in the scene long enough to fill its Stress track with damage from the Deterrent which generally causes 1 Stress per round of actions.\nAll the time the Operators are applying the Deterrent in this way the threat continues to act against them, or the Deterrent that is doing them harm, or it could use a Power to escape the scene. Operators need to act to keep it in the light, or fully immersed in the water, etc., or survive while the blazing torch the threat has come to resemble continues to try to kill them.",
