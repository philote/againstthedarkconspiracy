    "description": "The table may define a legendary monster-slaying weapon. Every success to take them out causes Stress that cannot be regenerated ‘on screen’. Control may say it can never be recovered in which case the very sight of the weapon might cause a threat to take fright and attempt to escape the scene. It might take several attempts before the team has a plan that successfully holds the threat in the scene long enough to finish it.\nGiven the potency of such a weapon it should be very hard to find. The team might have to confirm it even exists, work out where it has lain for the last few centuries, and then finally defeat any guardians protecting it. Then they can begin to think about confronting a Supernatural nemesis with it. In this respect it resembles the difficulty of finding a True Name, and the quest to find it could constitute a significant arc of Operations.Whatever material the threat is vulnerable to it should be difficult to get without additional INTEL spends or a call on a Contact. If there were simple ways to kill these things they would not have survived to be a challenge to the team. Generally, the more easily obtainable it is the more specific should the circumstances around its use be. So, ‘wood’ might have to be of a particular tree or collected at a particular time or under particular circumstances.",
