    "description": "... wood, bronze, meteoric iron, flint, obsidian, silver are all options, or it could be something else. Stress applied using a weapon made from this material cannot be regenerated ‘on screen’, and perhaps not at all.\nWhatever material the threat is vulnerable to it should be difficult to get without additional INTEL spends or a call on a Contact. If there were simple ways to kill these things they would not have survived to be a challenge to the team. Generally, the more easily obtainable it is the more specific should the circumstances around its use be. So, ‘wood’ might have to be of a particular tree or collected at a particular time or under particular circumstances.",
