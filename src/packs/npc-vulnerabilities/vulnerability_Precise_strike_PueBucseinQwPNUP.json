    "description": "Control will agree whether this is beheading or penetration of a particular organ such as its ‘heart’ or ‘brain’, or even destroying something it wears or even carries.\nIt is the only way to capitalize on mundane damage that’s already been applied. Operator successes with mundane weapons fill the Stress track as the threat’s resilience and ability to keep track of what’s happening is driven down. Control will say when it’s within 2 Stress of being finished.\nThat is the only time that the Precise Strike with a mundane weapon is able to deliver a final coup de grace. Success applies 1 Stress, but brilliant success applies 2, so it may take two hacks with the kukri to take of its head once it has been sufficiently beaten down by mundane damage.Whatever material the threat is vulnerable to it should be difficult to get without additional INTEL spends or a call on a Contact. If there were simple ways to kill these things they would not have survived to be a challenge to the team. Generally, the more easily obtainable it is the more specific should the circumstances around its use be. So, ‘wood’ might have to be of a particular tree or collected at a particular time or under particular circumstances.",
