    "description": "Control will say how a Supernaturalâ€™s True Name could be discovered. Perhaps zombies can be distracted if you call them by the name they had in life, or the name of a loved one. Perhaps all demons or fae have a true name that gives the speaker some power over them. Whatever the approach, it could require a series of Operations to track down and steal the True Name. Indeed it could be a significant drive for the Conspiracy to conceal such dangerous information from mortals, and an entire campaign arc could deal with the search.",
