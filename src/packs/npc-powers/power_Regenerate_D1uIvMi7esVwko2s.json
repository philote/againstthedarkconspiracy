    "description": "While mundane weapons appear to do harm, the effect is transitory. Control says how quickly Stress applied by mundane weapons recovers. If it is before the Operators’ eyes, then they should erase one Stress after everyone has taken an action as wounds seal themselves and bones reset. It’s still possible to fill the Stress track if Operator’s can cooperate to apply Stress very quickly and Control will judge if this drives the threat out of the scene, but mundane damage never finishes it.\nDismembering or burning the threat to ashes only causes a greater delay in their regeneration unless a Vulnerability has been targeted. Their regeneration simply requires more time ‘off-screen’. Perhaps a ritual must be performed, or a sacrifice offered. For vampires this may be time in their grave soil soaked in fresh blood, for demons it might require penance in Hell while for fae it might require the balm of time in the Otherworld.\nWherever and how ever it occurs, there should be a cut scene confirming to the players that it’s just a matter of time before it returns. The cut scene should also ensure they know there have been some consequences to innocents of their failure to finish the job. Perhaps we see the blood being ‘harvested’, or the demon or fae ‘at play’ with a mortal.",
