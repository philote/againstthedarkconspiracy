These are impossible to hit with a bullet so swarms should either be avoided or run from, unless the Operator can deploy fire or something with a similar area effect against them. They can force Operators to split up or drive them towards a more serious threat. Control will say if they draw blood or clog mouths or noses, in which case a roll to take them out them will be necessary during which only the Operator is at risk unless they have a means to do the swarm harm.",
