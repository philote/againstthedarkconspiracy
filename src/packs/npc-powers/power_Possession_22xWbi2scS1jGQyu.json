    "description": "This works a little like Mesmerism but can only target one bystander or Operator at a time. If the threat was visible, it disappears creating the fictional positioning for a threat to be carried by a mortal as a passenger, only materializing when it chooses to or when tempted forth. Each time it seeks to control the actions of a possessed Operator they can roll to do something else to displace it. Generally, once evicted the threat cannot possess the same mortal again, at least not in the same scene.",
